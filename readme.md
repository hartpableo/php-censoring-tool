# PHP Tool: Censor Links and Email Addresses in a Body Text

This is a simple PHP censoring tool used to hide emails and links in a text. Can get pretty useful when having to deal with a similar thing on data taken from the database.

## Sample

1. Open your terminal and make sure you have PHP installed in your machine.
2. Go to the root of this project.
3. Command `php index.php` and see the filtered content of `test.html` in your terminal.
